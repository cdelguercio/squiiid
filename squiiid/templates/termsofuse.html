  <h1>Squiiid Terms of Service Policy</h1>
  <h2>Last Updated: 09/01/13</h2>
  <p><b>Acceptance</b><br/>You learned it on the playground. While our focus is to provide an outlet and marketplace for creative expression, we seek to do so in a healthy atmosphere for preserving and fostering social, moral and legal values.  Therefore, Your use of Squiiid (together with its website “Squiiid.com” and all associated services, content and domains, collectively, the “Service”) is predicated on Your acceptance of this Terms of Service (the “Agreement”). If You (the “Subscriber” or “You”) do not accept this Agreement, You are not permitted to use the Service and should not do so.</p>
  <p>Squiiid allows You to upload Your creative content, share it to a blog or website of your choice, and to share/reblog the content of others (unless otherwise stated). Your creative content may then be blogged and reblogged. You agree to be bound by the Terms of Service whether or not You are a registered user of the Service. Squiiid reserves the right to make modifications to this Agreement at any time by posting a revised agreement on its website and notifying users, generally by e-mail. You should review any such modifications, and Your continued use of the Service will constitute Your acceptance of the revised Agreement.  Modifications will become effective when posted.</p>
  <p><b>Eligibility and Use of Service</b><br/>Squiiid is not available to anyone who cannot form a legally binding agreement with the Service or who cannot legally comply with the Agreement or with applicable laws. By law, this precludes all individuals under the age of thirteen. No one who has not reached the age of thirteen (including grandparents) may use the Service.</p>
  <p>Squiiid is a nascent service. As it grows and evolves, we reserve the right to makes changes to the Service, its features, capabilities and limits, or even stop providing the Service to users or to You, without prior notice.</p>
  <p>To use certain features of the Service, You may be required to create an account with Squiiid and to select a username and password. The information You provide during registration should be accurate and valid, including Your e-mail address. This is the address we will use to contact You whenever necessary. If You forget Your usernmame or password, we cannot assist You without Your correct e-mail address.</p>
  <p>You may not use a Squiiid account in any way to attempt to impersonate another person or entity or to disguise or confuse others as to the ownership or authorship of information You post, blog or reblog.</p>
  <p><b>Your Content, Its Uses and Licenses</b><br/>You can upload Your creative content to Squiiid for use by the Service, other users and Yourself in ways consistent with Squiiid’s stated purposes. User or subscriber creative expression (“Subscriber Content”) includes without limitation all graphics, photographs, images, illustrations, video, audio, and written expression to include information, comments, posts, blogs, scripts, links and interactive tools that are uploaded, posted or otherwise transferred to the Service by a Subscriber. All Intellectual Property rights within a subscriber’s content are retained by the Subcriber. You retain all rights to the Subscriber Content You post to the Service except for the licenses You grant pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
  <p>In transferring Subscriber Content to Squiiid, You grant Squiiid a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, license to use, display, reproduce, publish, modify, share, comment, blog and reblog such content. Your content can be used to operate the Service for You and other Squiiid users, for publishing on digital social media platforms, and to allow Squiiid to improve and expand its services and to develop new functionalities. You agree that You have the requisite rights to Subcriber Content You provide to the Service and grant us the license rights described herein, and that You will respect the Intellectual property rights of others.</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that Squiiid is a public platform, and Your Subcriber Content will be seen and made available to other users. When something is made available anywhere on the internet, it is practically impossible to recapture all copies of it or to prevent others from commenting on or distributing it, even if You stop using the Service. For this reason, the license to Your Subscriber Content will continue even if or when You discontinue using the Service.</p>
  <p>In addition to the above, You agree not to upload Subcriber Content that may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infringe on the rights of others, including rights to privacy, intellectual property, publicity or other personal rights;</li>
    <li>Create a risk of social unrest, violence, physical harm, death, emotional distress, or property damage to any person or entity, including actions that promote hatred or violence to individuals or groups on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, gender or disability;</li>
    <li>Exploit children or minors through exposure to information that tends to identify, humiliate, bully or harass them, or promotes a risk of harm, self-harm, violence or sexually explicit behavior. Do not request personally identifiable details, characteristics or traits or incite minors to courses of action that may result in harm to themselves or others;</li>
    <li>Contain information or portrayals that are excessively violent, gory, sexually graphic or suggestive of torture to human beings or animals.  Similarly, Subscriber Content should not be hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, libelous, profane, threatening or humiliating to individuals or groups;</li>
    <li>Disclose information whose disclosure is prohibited by law, such as insider trading information or trade secrets of others;</li>
    <li>Inject spam or undesired or deceptive messages or content in Your posts. This includes interstitial pop-up ads or commercial messages in blogs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Squiiid reserves the right to remove Subscriber Content for any reason, without notice or explanation. In the event we deem that repeated or egregious violations of these Terms of Service have occurred, Your account may be blocked to future activity or cancelled completely. These rights do not commit or obligate us to a particular course of action in any situation.</p>

Squiiid has committed itself to be alert to violations of copyright law and will respond promptly to claims of infringement on its site when reported to its designated Copyright Agent noted below.</p>
  <p><b>Reporting Infringements of Copyright</b><br/>If You believe that Content on Squiiid infringes on Your copyright or the right of another who has authorized to act on his behalf, You may file a Notice of Infringement with Squiiid’s Copyright Agent.

In its sole discretion, Squiiid reserves the right to terminate membership of a subscriber who is the subject of repeated claims or violations.</p>

You also agree that Squiiid assumes no responsibility or liability arising out of Subscriber Content or any material You send or post to the Service.

Accordingly, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California and by no other state or legal jurisdiction. In the event of a legal dispute, You and Squiiid each agree to submit to a state court located within Los Angeles County, California or to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for any actions in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>
  <p><b>Entire Agreement</b><br/>This Agreement, including any amendments or other agreements You may enter into with Squiiid in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire Agreement between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is judged invalid by a court or legal jurisdiction, that provision shall be severed from the Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
